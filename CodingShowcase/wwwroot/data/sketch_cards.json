    "Blurb": "I was inspired to create this after thinking about how a 3D representation of Conway's Game of Life might look.  Initially the representation was going to be a cube for which I decided that corner neighbors of corners would wrap to the opposite corner of the same face.  For an additional challenge I forced myself to use only p5.js and no additional libraries for JavaScript and to represent my cube that contains the game on a sphere known as a Cubed Sphere.",
